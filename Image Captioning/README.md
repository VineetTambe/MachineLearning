# ImageCaptioning implementation 

Img_cap_model.ipynb contains the model which is trained on a small part of the MSCOCO 2014 dataset.\
The dataset can be downloaded from: https://cocodataset.org/#download
[Cautioin: Large dataset - 13GB]

The overall approach to the model built is similar to: https://github.com/VineetTambe/MachineLearning/tree/master/SonnetGeneration

The only difference being that the image starts the prediction cycle.
